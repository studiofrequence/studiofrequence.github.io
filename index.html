							<h2> How To Play</h2>
							<ul>
									<li> 
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">Next Star System is a robot battle game in space. You will take your high-powered telescope and scour the stars for new alien worlds, then assemble a team of robots, each with unique abilities, to dispatch a mission! <br/>
										In Next Star System, your objective is to collect more treasures than your enemy before time runs out. To collect a treasure, you need to carry it toward your base on the surface of the planet. To win, you need to use the right robot at the right moment, build strategic combinations of them, and stop your opponent from collecting treasures.  

										</p>

										<p> <br/></p>
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">
											• As you progress through the galaxy, you will unlock more telescopes and upgrade them, as well as your robots, to expand your realm in the galaxy. If you just started playing, you might find our gameplay video helpful. You may refer to our beginner-level tips, tricks, and strategies section to learn the best ways to beat other players in PvP matches. 
										</p>
									</li>
									
									<br/>
									<li>
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">
											• Knowing each robot’s abilities and powers not only help you make use of their powers at the right moment, but also allow you to launch then in proper positions. On the cards page, tap on each robot’s card in your line-up to know their abilities. A robot’s card also displays various characteristics, such as stamina, mass, shot power, etc.  
										</p>

									</li>
									
									<p> <br/></p>
									<li>
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">
											•  There are three types of robots: some only care about treasures, some only about enemy robots, and others about both. Use a combination of these robots to collect treasures and prevent your enemy to do so. 
										</p>
									</li>
									
									<br/>
									<li>
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">
											•  Your team contains a line-up of eight robots. During a match, four of them can be used at all times. However, once you use a robot, the next in line comes into play. Your robots require a certain amount of energy. Your energy bar shows how much you have left. You start a match with five energy points and gain one every second. Energy management is an essential part of the game. If you spend it fast, you cannot place new robots on the field until it regenerates. As a general rule, the stronger a robot is, the more energy it uses. 
										</p>
										<img src="images3/team.png" style='width:100%;max-width:1000px;' border="0" alt="Team" />
									</li>
									
									<p> <br/></p>
									<li>
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">
											•  Learning how to master the sling is crucial. Always keep your left thumb on the controller and use your right thumb to sling the robots. You can swipe in any direction with your right thumb to adjust your throw angle.
										</p>
										<img src="images3/hold.png" style='width:100%;max-width:1000px;' border="0" alt="Hold" />
									</li>
									
									<p> <br/></p>
									<li>
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">
											•  The Poles are mysterious places. When trapped in the Poles, do not underestimate the power of explosives. 
										</p>
										<img src="images3/pole.png" style='width:100%;max-width:1000px;' border="0" alt="Pole" />
									</li>
									
									<p> <br/></p>
									<li>
										<p style="font-size:80%; text-align:left;">
											•  Upgrading your robots is crucial to keep winning trophies and progress through telescope levels. You will meet tougher opponents as you keep playing. Upgrading your telescope and your robots will increase your chance to win.
